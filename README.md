# Disorder_for_MP

This is a python notebook to plot pymatgen phase diagram with points which have as additional information disorder state and configurational entropy. Disorder and configurational entropy are predicted by pre-trained CrabNet models (https://github.com/anthony-wang/CrabNet). Both models are trained using data extracted from ICSD using the package https://github.com/epatyukova/Disorder.
